# Bullscript

Bullscript is a language for the web. It allows you to create a SPA front-end, a back-end and a database all in one project.

# Early Development Stage

Currently in the early development stages. Not ready for use, but available for those interested.

# Examples

## Hello world

Compiling will produce dist/app.js. If you run `node dist/app.js` a web server will run and serve an HTML page that says `Hello world`.

### main.bs

```
# component

"Hello world"
```
